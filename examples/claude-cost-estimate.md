# AWS Cost Analysis: Scotustician Pipeline

*Generated by Claude Code on 2025-08-07*

## Overview

This document provides detailed cost estimates for running the Scotustician SCOTUS oral argument processing pipeline on AWS. The pipeline consists of two main components:

1. **Ingest Service** - Collects oral argument data from Oyez.org API
2. **Transformers Service** - Generates embeddings using BGE-M3 model

## ðŸ’° Cost Breakdown

### Ingest Job Costs

**Configuration:**
- AWS Fargate: 1 vCPU + 3GB RAM
- Cost: **$0.054/hour**

**Scenarios:**

*Note: Duration estimates account for Oyez.org API rate limiting (~1-2 requests/second)*  
*API reliably provides data from 1980 onwards (~45 terms, ~3,600 cases total)*

| Scenario | Cases | Duration | Total Cost | Cost/Case |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Single term (2023-24) | 90 | 1.5 hours | **$0.08** | $0.0009 |
| 5 years (2019-24) | 450 | 6.0 hours | **$0.32** | $0.0007 |
| 10 years (2014-24) | 900 | 12.0 hours | **$0.65** | $0.0007 |
| Full available data (1980-24) | 3,600 | 40.0 hours | **$2.16** | $0.0006 |

**Scheduled Operations:**
- **Frequency:** 2x/week (Monday & Thursday, 10 AM UTC)
- **Duration:** 5-15 minutes (incremental updates only)
- **Cost per run:** $0.013
- **Monthly cost:** ~$0.11

### Transformers Job Costs

**Configurations:**

**CPU-Only (AWS Fargate):**
- 2 vCPUs + 8GB RAM
- Cost: **$0.117/hour**

**GPU-Enabled (EC2 Spot):**
- g4dn.xlarge instance
- Cost: **~$0.20/hour** (spot pricing, ~70% savings vs on-demand)

**Processing Scenarios:**

| Job Size | CPU Cost | CPU Time | GPU Cost | GPU Time | GPU Savings |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **100 cases** | $0.07 | 0.6 hours | **$0.03** | 0.15 hours | $0.04 (57%) |
| **1,000 cases** | $0.69 | 5.9 hours | **$0.30** | 1.5 hours | $0.39 (57%) |
| **5,000 cases** | $3.45 | 29.6 hours | **$1.48** | 7.4 hours | $1.97 (57%) |

## ðŸ’¾ Storage Costs (Monthly)

**Per 1,000 cases:**
- S3 storage (JSON + XML): ~$0.02/month
- ECR container images: ~$0.20/month
- **Total storage:** ~$0.22/month per 1,000 cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Cost Examples

### Scenario 1: Research Project (500 cases)
```
Initial Setup:
â€¢ Ingest: 500 cases Ã— $0.0007 = $0.35
â€¢ Transform: 500 cases (GPU) = $0.15
â€¢ Storage: $0.11/month
â€¢ Total first month: $0.61
```

### Scenario 2: Full Available Dataset (3,600 cases, 1980-2024)
```
Initial Setup:
â€¢ Ingest: 3,600 cases = $2.16
â€¢ Transform: 3,600 cases (GPU) = $1.07
â€¢ Storage: $0.80/month  
â€¢ Total first month: $4.03
```

### Scenario 3: Production with Updates
```
Monthly Operations:
â€¢ Scheduled ingest: $0.11/month
â€¢ New case processing: ~$0.05/month
â€¢ Storage: $0.44/month (2k cases)
â€¢ Total ongoing: $0.60/month
```

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

### Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Use GPU for medium-large jobs** (>500 cases)
   - 4x faster processing
   - 57% cost savings despite higher hourly rate

2. **Leverage Spot Instances** (already configured)
   - ~70% savings over on-demand pricing
   - Automatic failover to on-demand if needed

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Minimize container startup overhead
   - Process multiple cases per job invocation

4. **Incremental Updates**
   - Scheduled jobs only process new cases
   - Extremely low ongoing costs

### Cost Comparison with Alternatives

**vs. Running Locally:**
- No hardware depreciation costs
- No electricity/cooling costs  
- Pay-per-use model
- Professional-grade infrastructure

**vs. Other Cloud Providers:**
- AWS Fargate pricing competitive
- Spot instance savings significant
- Integrated S3/ECR ecosystem

## ðŸš€ Scalability Analysis

The pipeline scales cost-effectively:

| Dataset Size | One-time Setup | Monthly Ongoing |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Small** (100 cases) | $0.15 | $0.13 |
| **Medium** (1,000 cases) | $1.00 | $0.33 |
| **Large** (3,600 cases, full available) | $4.03 | $0.91 |

## ðŸ’¡ Cost Control Features

**Built-in Cost Controls:**
- Spot instance automatic bidding
- Container resource limits prevent runaway costs
- Fargate eliminates idle server costs
- S3 lifecycle policies for long-term storage

**Monitoring:**
- CloudWatch cost alerts
- ECS task execution logs
- Automatic scaling based on demand

## Summary

The Scotustician pipeline is **cost-effective**:
- **Initial setup:** $0.15 - $4.03 depending on dataset size
- **Ongoing operations:** $0.13 - $0.91/month
- **Cost per case:** ~$0.0006 - $0.0010

**Key considerations:**
- API rate limiting makes ingest jobs run 3-4x longer than pure compute time
- Full available dataset (1980-2024) contains ~3,600 cases, not 2,000+
- Storage costs remain negligible compared to compute
- GPU-enabled transformers provide significant time and cost savings

*For most academic and research use cases, expect total costs under $5.00 for initial setup and under $1.00/month ongoing.*
