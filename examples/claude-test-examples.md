# Pipeline Testing Examples

This document outlines potential test cases for the Scotustician pipeline orchestration system. These tests cover the key logic components to ensure reliable data processing and system resilience.

## Unit Tests

def test_error_handling_configuration():
    # Validate retry policies and error states for each step
```

**Test Task Configuration Generation**
```python
def test_ecs_task_definition_generation():
    # Test task definitions created with correct parameters
    
def test_environment_variable_mapping():
    # Validate S3 paths, years, processing flags are set correctly
    
def test_resource_allocation():
    # Test CPU/memory allocation based on processing type
```

**Test S3 Path Resolution**

    # Test pipeline resilience to step failures

    # Test pipeline resumption after manual fixes
```

## Load and Performance Tests

### Concurrent Processing

**Test Parallel Execution**
```python

    # Test pipeline performance under increasing load
```

**Test Historical Backfill**
```python
def test_large_scale_processing():
    # Test processing multiple years of historical data
    
def test_memory_efficiency():
    # Monitor memory usage during large dataset processing
    
def test_long_running_stability():
    # Test pipeline stability over extended execution periods
```

## Test Data Setup

### Mock Data Generation

**Test Case Data**
```python
